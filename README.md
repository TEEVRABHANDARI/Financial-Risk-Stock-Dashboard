The Dashboard provides a detailed overview of Apple's stock trends from **January 2, 2014, to December 31, 2024**. The dashboard includes visual representations of the stock's closing prices and moving averages (10-day, 20-day, and 50-day), offering a clear view of its growth trajectory over time. The line chart highlights the consistent upward trend in the stock's value, indicating **bullish momentum** in recent years.

A pie chart illustrates the annual volume distribution, offering insights into the trading activity year by year, with noticeable peaks that reflect higher investor interest or market events. Key stock information, such as the **starting closing value ($17.23)** and **ending closing value ($250.42)**, is prominently displayed, emphasizing the substantial growth over the analyzed period.

The dashboard also evaluates market direction (bullish, bearish, or neutral) using trend signals, which classify Apple's current state as "bullish." Users can interact with the date range slider to customize the analysis period and assess performance for specific durations. Additionally, the comparative view allows investors to analyze Apple's performance alongside other stocks, facilitating sector-wide or cross-stock comparisons. 

**Note**: Data is imported via python scripting in power bi which can be refreshed again which will reflect the latest stock values.Each of the stock values is in **USD**.

### Principle of Time Value of Money (TVM)

The **Time Value of Money (TVM)** is a fundamental financial principle that states that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its earning potential. This is because money today can be invested to generate returns, leading to a greater value in the future.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7547d9bd-7ec7-414c-919c-41eed8edd82e)


### Key Formulae in TVM

#### 1. **Future Value (FV)**
The value of an investment at a specific time in the future, considering the interest rate and the compounding effect.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/070e8f7f-d944-412e-84f6-f5acd66c9268)


- **FV**: Future Value  
- **PV**: Present Value  
- **r**: Annual interest rate (in decimal form)  
- **n**: Number of periods (years, months, etc.)  

#### 2. **Present Value (PV)**
The current worth of a future sum of money or cash flows given a specified rate of return.

- **PV**: Present Value  
- **FV**: Future Value  
- **r**: Annual interest rate (in decimal form)  
- **n**: Number of periods

### Example: Future Value Calculation

#### Scenario:  
You invest $1,000 today in a savings account that offers a 5% annual interest rate compounded yearly. You want to calculate its value after 5 years.

#### Solution:  
Using the **Future Value (FV)** formula:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498b3b06-00f9-404f-bbb5-e808ca894fac)


#### Result:
After 5 years, your investment will grow to **$1,276.28**.

Similarly, the **forecasted future value** has been calculated for every stock each data and plotted in the graph.
